This defines the "blueprint" allowed: let person: {name: string; age: number}
Matches the "blueprint" of the typed description
"blueprint" of an array of objects with a specific structure / [{name: string; age: number}, {}..., {}...]

Really feeling alot of similarity with classes, inheritance, etc.
